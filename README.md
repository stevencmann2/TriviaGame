# TriviaGame

This is a timed trivia game where the user will be prompted to start and complete a series of questions. The game will utilize HTML, Bootstrap CSS, JQuery, &amp; Javascript.

## Getting Started

To get started, make your way to the deployment link and click it. That will take you directly to the quiz, then simply begin the game and try and guess the ten questions correctly. Remeber, the quiz is timed for each question. 

### Problem Solving

One of the issues I ran into during this project was data structure. I was able to overcome this problem by structuing the data as objects. I used JSON (Javascirpt Object Notation) to call upon the data and through various hide/show functions, was able to get a working trivia style game.
